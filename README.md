# D3-challenge

A a scatter plot was created between two of the data variables Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.

Using the D3 techniques I created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. I coded the graphic using the app.js file of the homework directory. 

I pulled in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function.

I tried using the mehtod noted to open up the visualization however, I did try. 
Note: You'll need to use python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.
